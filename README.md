## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](reactrouter.com) - Routing library used to implement routing
- [Redux-Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - State Management library
- [Formik](formik.org) - Form management library
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

When i started, i had no idea how to implement some features of the application such as routing, state management using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and form management, but in the process of building it, I learned how to use Redux-Toolkit, React Router to do these things.

Also, i learned about CSS Grid Template areas. They really made it easy for me to structure the webpage and make it responsive

### Continued development

I plan on diving deeper into the more advanced concepts of React and my next project would probably be something that involves a third-party API, authentication and web sockets

### Useful resources
